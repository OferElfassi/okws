Setting Up Okd To Run on FreeBSD
--------------------------------

1. User IDs and Groups
----------------------

OkD should be configured with 2 user/groups:

	okd - user for running all helper services such as logging
	      and pub. should have some privileges to access the file
	      system for reading and for writing.

	www - user for running web services -- should only have access
	      to the file system for writine core files.

FreeBSD already has www/www. For OKD, add the user okd/okd:

	/etc/passwd:

		okd:*:90:90:OK Daemon User:/nonexistant:/sbin/nologin

	/etc/group:

		okd:*:90:

Thus, in your /etc/sfs/okd_config file, you might have something like:

	ServiceUser	www
	ServiceGroup	www
	OkdUser		okd
	OkdGroup	okd


2. Coredumps
-------------

Getting your broken OK services to dump core is a bit tricky, since they
will be running in a chroot jail, without write or read privileges. The
easiest way I've found around this is to do the following:

	a. Change the system-wide coredump location.  In a startup file
	   add the line:
	
		sysctl kern.corefile="/var/coredumps/%U/%N.core"
	   
           This will tell the kernel to dump core in the given directory,
	   where %U is substituted with the user's ID.  Note that this
  	   directory must exist, and must be writable by the user, or
   	   else the kernel won't dump core there.

	b. You need to make the appropriate directories available in your
 	   chroot jail.  That is, cd into your chroot jail:

		mkdir -p var/coredumps
	        cd var/coredumps
		mkdir 80 90
		chown 80 80
		chown 90 90

3. Syslogging
-------------

	When run as root and in the background, all messages sent to 
	standard error will be redirected to the syslogger.  To do
	this, introduce the following rule in /etc/syslog.conf:

		local3.*	/var/log/okd
